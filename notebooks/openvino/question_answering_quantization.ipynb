    "### Quantize the Model with Quantization Aware Training\n",
    "\n",
    "For quantization aware training, we create a QuestionAnsweringTrainer. This Trainer is defined in [trainer_qa.py](trainer_qa.py) and taken from the [Question Answering example](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/tree/main/examples/openvino/question-answering). It is a modified version of the standard Hugging Face [QuestionAnsweringTrainer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering) that adds quantization aware training with [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/). See the Hugging Face [Trainer documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) for more information on the Trainer class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the standard training arguments, the QuestionAnsweringTrainer for NNCF requires an `ov_config` parameter with quantization settings. The default `OVConfig()` settings should work well for many cases. For more information about modifying the settings, or to understand what the settings mean, please refer to the [NNCF quantization documentation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md)"

Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. The Broncos' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks. Jordan Norwood's 61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down, while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15. The two teams' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low. Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams, while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player.\n"
